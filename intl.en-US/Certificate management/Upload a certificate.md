# Upload a certificate {#task_ayx_qqn_vdb .task}

Before creating HTTPS listeners, you must upload the required server certificate and CA certificate to SLB.Â  You no longer need to configure certificates on the backend servers after uploading the certificates to SLB.

-   You have purchased a server certificate.
-   You have generated a CA certificate and client certificate. For more information, see [Generate a CA certificate](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New Console)/Certificate management/Generate a CA certificate.md#).

Note the following before uploading certificates:

-   If you want to use a certificate in multiple regions, you must upload the certificate to all these regions.
-   Up to 100 certificates can be uploaded per account.

1.  Log on to the [SLB console](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/login-required#/slb). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Certificates**. 
3.  Click **Create Certificate**.
