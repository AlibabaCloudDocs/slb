# Replace a certificate {#task_ayx_qqn_vdb .task}

To avoid the impact of certificate expiration on your service, we recommend that you replace the certificate before the certificate expires.

1.  Create and upload a new certificate. For more information, see [Generate a CA certificate](reseller.en-US/Certificate management/Generate a CA certificate.md#) and [Create a certificate](reseller.en-US/Certificate management/Create a certificate.md#).
2.  Configure the new certificate in HTTPS listener configuration. For more information, see [Add an HTTPS listener](reseller.en-US/Listeners/Add an HTTPS listener.md#).
3.  On the Certificates page, find the target certificate, and then click **Delete**.
4.  In the displayed dialog box, click **OK**.
