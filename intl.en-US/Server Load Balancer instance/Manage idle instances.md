# Manage idle instances {#task_njr_nmg_4gb .task}

This topic describes how to use the Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) console to display the Pay-As-You-Go instances that have been idle for more than seven days.

1.  Log on to the [Server Load Balancer console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com/slb). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **SLB Lab** \> **Idle SLB instances**. 
3.  On the Idle SLB instance page, view all the Pay-As-You-Go instances that have not been used for more than seven days. You can click **![](images/38070_en-US.png)** to customize the display of **IP Address** and **Idle Cause**. 
4.  To release an idle instance, click **Release** from the **Actions** column to immediately release the instance. 

    **Note:** Given that the data of idle instances has a one-day cache period, make sure that the instance you want to release is not in use to prevent possible exceptions.
