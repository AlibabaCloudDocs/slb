This topic describes how to release a Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance. You can release an SLB instance immediately or at a specified time.

1.  Log on to the [SLB console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com/slb/cn-hangzhou). 
2.  Find the target instance and click **More** \> **Release**. 

    You can select multiple SLB instances at a time and click **Release** at the bottom of the page to release SLB instances in batches.

3.  On the Release page, select **Release Now** or **Release on Schedule**. 

    **Note:** While the system executes the release operation every half hour or one hour cycle, the billing of the instance is stopped immediately at the release time you set.

4.  Click **Next**. 
5.  Confirm the displayed information and click **OK** to release the instance.
