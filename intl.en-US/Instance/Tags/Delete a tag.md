# Delete a tag {#task_1563613 .task}

Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) does not support deleting tags of multiple instances in batches. You can remove the tags of only one instance at a time.

1.  Log on to the [Server Load Balancer console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/slb). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances** \> **Server Load Balancer**.
3.  Select the region of the target SLB instance and find the target SLB instance.
4.  In the **Actions** column, choose **More** \> **Edit Tags**.
5.  On the Edit Tags page, click the delete icon next to the tag to be removed, and then click **OK**. 

    **Note:** If a tag is removed from an SLB instance and is not associated with any other instances, the tag is deleted from the system.
