# Overview {#concept_dhb_cm3_42b .concept}

You can classify Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances by using tags.

Each tag consists of a key and a value. Before you use tags, note the following limits:

-   A tag cannot exist on its own and must be associated with an SLB instance.
-   Up to 10 tags can be associated with an SLB instance.
-   The key of each tag associated with an instance must be unique. Tags with the same key will be overwritten.
-   Tags cannot be used across regions and are region-specific resources. For example, tags that belong to the China \(Hangzhou\) region are invisible to the China \(Shanghai\) region.
