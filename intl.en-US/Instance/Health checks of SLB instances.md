This topic describes how to check the status of Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances, specifically by viewing the results of health assessment, Anti-DDoS Basic status check, certificate status detection, access control detection, billing status detection, and idle instance detection. The health check function also provides causes and standard solutions for detected exceptions.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances** \> **Server Load Balancer**.
