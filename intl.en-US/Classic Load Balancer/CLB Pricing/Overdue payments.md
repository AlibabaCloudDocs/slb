# Overdue payments

Your SLB instance will not be suspended immediately after the instance is overdue. Still, we recommend that you renew your SLB instance in a timely manner to avoid impacts on your business.

The following rules apply when your pay-as-you-go SLB instance is overdue:

-   The instance keeps running for 15 days before it is locked.

    When the instance is locked, the system stops billing for it.

-   The instance is automatically released if it remains overdue 15 days after the instance is locked.

    An email notification is sent to you one day before the instance is released. The configurations and related data are removed and cannot be restored after the instance is released.
