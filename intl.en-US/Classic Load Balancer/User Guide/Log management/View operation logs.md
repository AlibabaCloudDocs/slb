You can view the operation logs of Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances, HTTP listeners, and server certificates over the last month.

You can query operation logs in the ActionTrail console. ActionTrail records the operations performed on resources under your Alibaba Cloud account, stores the operation records in your specified OSS buckets, and allows you to query the operation records.

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Logs** \> **Operation Logs**.

3.  To view an operation log, click the ![icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1558921161/p230645.png) icon to the left of the operation log.

4.  On the Operation Logs page, perform the following operations to view the operation log:

    1.  Select an event type from the upper-left drop-down list.

        In this example, **any type** can be selected.
