# Preparations

Before you execute the files of Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) SDK for Python to use SLB features, you must complete the common configurations.

Before you run the code in script mode, make sure that the following requirements are met:

1.  Your account has a balance of at least CNY 100 so that you can be charged the instance fee when you use SLB SDK for Python to create an SLB instance.
2.  An AccessKey pair is obtained.

    An AccessKey ID and an AccessKey secret that are used to verify your identity are obtained. For more information about how to obtain an AccessKey pair, see [Obtain an AccessKey pair](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/User Guide/Developer Guide/Obtain an AccessKey pair.md).

3.  The [SLB Python example library](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-openapi-python-sdk-examples) for implementing SLB features with Alibaba Cloud SLB SDK for Python is downloaded.
4.  Go to the directory where setup.py is stored and run the following command to initialize the environment:

    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
