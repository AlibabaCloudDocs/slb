# Set alert rules in the Cloud Monitor console

This topic describes how to set alert rules. After you activate the Cloud Monitor service, you can configure alert rules for Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances in the Cloud Monitor console.

**Note:** If a listener or an SLB instance is deleted, its alert rules are also deleted.

1.  Log on to the [SLB console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com).

2.  Select the region where the SLB instance for which you want to configure alert rules is deployed.

3.  Find the SLB instance and click ![](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1113359951/p7338.png) in the Monitoring column.

    **Note:** Make sure that you have configured a listener and enabled the health check feature for the SLB instance.

4.  Click **Threshold Alerting Settings**. You are then directed to the Cloud Monitor console.
