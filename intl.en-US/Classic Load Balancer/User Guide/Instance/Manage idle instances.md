# Manage idle instances

This topic describes how to use the Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) console to display the pay-as-you-go instances that have been idle for more than seven days.

1.  Log on to the [Server Load Balancer console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com/slb).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **SLB Lab** \> **Idle SLB instances**.

3.  On the Idle SLB instances page, view all the pay-as-you-go instances that have not been used for more than seven days. You can click **![](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0723498951/p38070.png)** to customize the display of IP Address and Idle Cause.

4.  To release an idle instance, click **Release** in the **Actions** column to immediately release the instance.

    **Note:** Given that the data of idle instances has a one-day cache period, make sure that the instance you want to release is not in use to prevent possible exceptions.
