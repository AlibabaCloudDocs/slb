# Overview

This quick start tutotial describes how to create a public-facing Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance and how to forward requests to two backend servers.

**Note:** Before creating an SLB instance, you must determine the region, type, and billing method of the SLB instance. For more information, see [Before you begin](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Before you begin.md).

This tutotial includes the following content:

1.  [Create an SLB instance]()

    Create an SLB instance. An SLB instance is a running entity of the SLB service.

2.  [Add listeners and backend servers.](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Configure an SLB instance.md)

    Configure listening rules and backend servers for the SLB instance.

3.  [Resolve a domain name](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Resolve a domain name.md) \(Optional\)

    Use Alibaba Cloud DNS to resolve a domain name to the IP address of the SLB instance. After that, the SLB instance can provide external services.

4.  [Release an SLB instance](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Release an SLB instance.md)

    If you no longer need the SLB instance, delete it to avoid extra fees.
