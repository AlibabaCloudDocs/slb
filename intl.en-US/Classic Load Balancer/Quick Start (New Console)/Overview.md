# Overview

This topic describes how to create an Internet SLB instance and forward client requests to two ECS instances that act as backend servers.

**Note:** Before you create an SLB instance, you must plan its configurations such as the instance type, region, and billing method. For more information, see [Before you begin](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Before you begin.md)For more information, see Before you begin.

Perform the following operations:

1.  [Create an SLB instance](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Create an SLB instance.md).

    Create an SLB instance. An SLB instance is an entity running the SLB service.

2.  [Add listeners and backend servers](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Configure an SLB instance.md).

    After you create an SLB instance, you must add listeners and backend servers.

3.  \(Optional\) [Resolve a domain name](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Resolve a domain name.md).

    Use Alibaba Cloud DNS to resolve a domain name to the IP address of the SLB instance. Then, the SLB instance can provide external services.

4.  [Release an SLB instance](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/Quick Start (New Console)/Release an SLB instance.md).

    If an SLB instance is no longer needed, delete the instance to avoid extra fees.
