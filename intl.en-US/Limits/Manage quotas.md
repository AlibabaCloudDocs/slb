4.  To increase the quota of a resource, click **Apply** in the **Actions** column to submit a quota increase application. 

    -   **Quantity for Application**: the number of resources you require. The quota you apply must be a number that is greater than the current quota. For more information about the resource limits of SLB, see [LimitsÂ ](reseller.en-US/Limits/Limits.md#).
    -   **Reason for Application**: the detailed reason for application, including the use scenario and the necessity of applying for a quota increase.
