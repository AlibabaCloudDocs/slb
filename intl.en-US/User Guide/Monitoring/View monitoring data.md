    SLB supports viewing the following monitor metrics.

    |Monitor metrics|Description|
    |:--------------|:----------|
    |**Traffic**|     -   Inbound Traffic: The traffic consumed by external access.
    -   Outbound Traffic: The traffic consumed by Server Load Balancer.
 |
    |**Packets**|     -   RX Packets Count: The number of request packets received per second.
    -   TX Packets Count: The number of response packets sent per second.
 |
    |**Concurrent Connections**|     -   Active Connections Count: The number of established TCP connections. If persistent connections are used, a connection can transfer multiple file requests at one time.
    -   Inactive Connections Count: The number of TCP connections that are not in the established status. You can use `netstat -an` command to view the active connections.
    -   Max Concurrent Connections Count: The total number of TCP connections.
 |
    |**Average Connection Requests Count**|The average number of new TCP connections established between clients and the Server Load Balancer in the statistical period.|
    |**Dropped Traffic**|     -   Dropped Inbound Traffic: The amount of inbound traffic dropped per second.
    -   Dropped Outbound Traffic: The amount of outbound traffic dropped per second.
 |
    |**Dropped Packets**|     -   Dropped RX Packets: The number of inbound packets dropped per second.
    -   Dropped TX Packets: The number of outbound packets dropped per second.
 |
    |**Dropped Connections**|The number of TCP connections dropped per second.|
    |The following metrics are specific to Layer-7 listeners.|
    |**Layer-7 Protocol QPS**|The number of HTTP/HTTPS requests that can be handled per second.|
    |**Response Time \(Listener\)**|The average response time of Server Load Balancer.|
    |**HTTP Status Code 2XX/3XX/4XX/5XX/Others \(Listener\)**|The average number of HTTP response codes generated by the listener.|
    |**Response Code 4xx/5xx \(Server\)**|The average number of HTTP response codes generated by the backend server.|
    |**Response Time \(Server\)**|The average response time of the backend server.|
