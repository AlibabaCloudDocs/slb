# View monitoring data {#task_jn4_vsc_f2b .task}

This topic describes how to use CloudMonitor to view the monitoring data of SLB instances.

1.  Log on to the [SLB console](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/login-required#/slb). 
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances** \> **Server Load Balancer**. 
3.  Select the region to which the target SLB instance belongs. 
4.  Find the target instance, and click the monitoring icon ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/15691/15561621227338_en-US.png) next to the instance. 
5.  Select the metric that you want to view.

    The following metrics are monitored for SLB instances.

    |Metric|Description|
    |:-----|:----------|
    |**Traffic**|     -   Inbound Traffic: the traffic sent from an external network to SLB
    -   Outbound Traffic: the traffic sent from SLB
 |
    |**Packets**|     -   RX Packets Count: the number of request packets received per second
    -   TX Packets Count: the number of response packets sent per second
 |
    |**Concurrent Connections**|     -   Active Connections Count: the number of established TCP connections. If persistent connections are configured, a connection can transfer multiple file requests at one time.
    -   Inactive Connections Count: the number of TCP connections not in the established state. You can use the `netstat -an` command to view the connections for both Windows and Linux servers.
    -   Max Concurrent Connections Count: the total number of TCP connections.
 |
    |**Average Connection Requests Count**|The average number of new TCP connections established between clients and SLB in a statistical period.|
    |**Dropped Traffic**|     -   Dropped Inbound Traffic: the amount of inbound traffic dropped per second
    -   Dropped Outbound Traffic: the amount of outbound traffic dropped per second
 |
    |**Dropped Packets**|     -   Dropped RX Packets: the number of inbound packets dropped per second
    -   Dropped TX Packets: the number of outbound packets dropped per second
 |
    |**Dropped Connections Count**|The number of TCP connections dropped per second|
    |The following metrics are specific to Layer-7 listeners.|
    |**Layer-7 Protocol QPS**|The number of HTTP/HTTPS requests that can be handled per second|
    |**Response Time \(Listener\)**|The average response time of SLB|
    |**HTTP Status Code 2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx/Others \(Listener\)**|The average number of HTTP response codes generated by listeners|
    |**Response Code 4xx/5xx \(Server\)**|The average number of HTTP response codes generated by backend servers|
    |**Response Time \(Server\)**|The average response time of backend servers|
