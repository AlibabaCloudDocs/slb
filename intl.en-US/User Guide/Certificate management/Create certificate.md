# Create certificate {#concept_ekm_gj1_dfb .concept}

To configure an HTTPS listener, you can directly use a certificate in SSL Certificate Service or upload the required third-party server certificate and CA certificate to the SLB. Then you no longer need to configure certificates on the backend servers.

SLB supports certificates from the following two resources:

-   Certificates issued or hosted by Alibaba Cloud SSL Certificate Service: You can select the certificate from Alibaba Cloud SSL Certificate Service. You will receive alerts when the certificate is about to expire, and can renew the certificate easily.

    Currently client CA certificates are not supported.

-   Third-party certificates: To upload a third-party certificate, you must have the public key/private key files of the certificate.

    HTTPS server certificates and client CA certificates are supported.


Note the following before creating a certificate:

-   If you want to use a certificate in multiple regions, you must select multiple regions when creating the certificate.
-   You can create up to 100 certificates per account.

## Select Certificate From SSL Certificate Service {#section_i3q_gm1_dfb .section}

Alibaba Cloud SSL Certificate Service issues digital certificates of different brands to provide HTTPS services for websites, so that the websites are trustworthy and are prevented from hijacking, tampering and interception. It also uniformly manages the life cycles of certificates to simplify certificate deployment.
