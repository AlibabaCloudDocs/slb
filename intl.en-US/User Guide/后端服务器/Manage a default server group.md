# Manage a default server group {#concept_ewt_whp_42b .concept}

Before using the SLB service, you must add at least one default server to receive client requests forwarded by SLB.

## Add default servers {#section_jqy_c3p_42b .section}

Before adding ECS instances to the default server group, make sure the following conditions are met:

-   You have [created an SLB instance](reseller.en-US/Archives/User Guide (Old Console)/SLB instances/Create an SLB instance.md#).
-   You have created ECS instances and deployed applications to process distributed requests.

To add ECS instances, complete these steps:

1.  Log on to the [SLB console](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/login-required#/slb).
2.  On the Server Load Balancer page, select a region.
3.  Click the ID of the target instance.
4.  Click the Default Server Group tab.
5.  Click **Add**.

7.  Click **OK**.
8.  In the Available Servers dialog box, specify the weights of ECS instances and click **OK**.

    Weight: An ECS instance with a higher weight receivers more requests.

    **Note:** If the weight is set to 0, no requests will be sent to the ECS instance.

    You can modify the ports and weights of added servers in batches.
