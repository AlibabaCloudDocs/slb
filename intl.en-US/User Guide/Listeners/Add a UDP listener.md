# Add a UDP listener {#concept_dy4_2pn_42b .concept}

Applicable to scenarios with preference for real-time content over reliability, such as video chats and pushes of real-time financial quotations. You can add a UDP listener to forward requests from the UDP protocol.

## Limits {#section_rln_3pn_42b .section}

Note the following before adding a UDP listener:

-   The maximum number of connections per listener: 100,000.
-   Currently, fragmented packets are not supported.
-   UDP listeners of an SLB instance of the classic network do not support viewing the source IP address.
-   In the following two scenarios, UDP listener configurations take effect after five minutes:
    -   Remove the backend ECS instances.
    -   Set the weight of a backend ECS instance to zero after the instance is declared as unhealthy.
-   Because IPv6 has a longer IP head than IPv4, when you use a UDP listener on an IPv6 SLB instance, you must ensure that the MTU of the NIC communicating with the SLB on the backend server \(ECS instance\) is not greater than 1480 \(some applications require synchronizing its configuration files based on this MTU value\), otherwise the packets may be discarded because they are too large.

    If you use a TCP/HTTP/HTTPS listener, no additional configurations are required because the TCP protocol supports MSS auto-negotiation.

## Step 2 Configure a UDP listener {#section_ly4_2pn_42b .section}

To configure a UDP listener, complete these steps:

1.  On the Protocol and Listener page, configure the UDP listener according to the following information.

    |Configuration|Description|
    |:------------|:----------|
    |**Select Listener Protocol**|Select the protocol type of the listener.In this tutorial, select **UDP**.

|
    |**Listening Port**|The listening port used to receive requests and forward the requests to backend servers.The port number is in the range of 1-65535.

**Note:** The listening ports must be unique in a Server Load Balancer instance.

|
    |**Advanced configurations**|
    |**Scheduling Algorithm**|Server Load Balancer supports three scheduling algorithms: round robin, weighted round robin \(WRR\), and weighted least connections \(WLC\).    -   **Weighted Round-Robin \(WRR\)**: Backend servers with higher weights receive more requests than those with smaller weights.
    -   **Round-Robin \(RR\)**: Requests are evenly and sequentially distributed to the backend servers.
    -   **Weighted Least Connections \(WLC\)**: A server with a higher weight will receive a larger percentage of live connections at any one time. When the weight value is the same, a backend server with a smaller number of connections is more frequently \(and probably\) accessed.
    -   **Consistency Hash \(CH \)**:

        -   **Source IP**: The consistent hash based on the source IP address. The same source IP addresses are scheduled to the same backend server.
        -   **Tuple**: The consistent hash based on the quaternion \(source IP + destination IP + source port + destination port\). The same steams are scheduled to the same backend server.
        -   **QUIC ID**: Consistent hash based on the QUIC Connection ID. The same QUIC Connection IDs are scheduled to the same backend server.
**Note:** 

The consistency Hash \(CH\) algorithm is only supported in the following areas currently:

        -   India \(Mumbai\)
        -   Japan \(Tokyo\)
        -   Singapore
        -   Australia \(Sydney\)
        -   Malaysia \(Kuala Lumpur\)
        -   Indonesia \(Jakarta\)
        -   Germany \(Frankfurt\)
        -   USA \(Silicon Valley\)
        -   US \(Virginia\)
        -   UAE \(Dubai\)
        -   China \(Huhhot\)
|
    |**Enable Access Control**|Select whether to enable the access control function.|
    |**Access Control Method**| Select an access control method after enabling the access control function:

     -   **Whitelist**: Only requests from IP addresses or CIDR blocks in the selected access control lists are forwarded. It applies to scenarios where the application only allows access from some specific IP addresses.

Enabling whitelist poses some business risks. After a whitelist is configured, only the IP addresses in the list can access the listener. If you enable the whitelist without adding any IP entry in the corresponding access control list, all requests are forwarded.

    -   **Blacklist**: Requests from IP addresses or CIDR blocks in the selected access control lists are not forwarded. It applies to scenarios where the application only denies access from some specific IP addresses.

If you enable a blacklist without adding any IP entry in the corresponding access control list, all requests are forwarded.

 |
    |**Access Control List**|Select an access control list as the whitelist or the blacklist.**Note:** An IPv6 instance can only bind IPv6 access control lists and an IPv4 instance can only bind IPv4 access control lists. For more information, see [Configure an access control list](reseller.en-US/Archives/User Guide (Old Console)/Access control/Configure an access control list.md#).

|
    |**Enable Peak Bandwidth Limit**| Select whether to configure the listener bandwidth.

 If the SLB instance is billed by bandwidth, you can set different peak bandwidths for different listeners to limit the traffic passing through the listeners. The sum of the peak bandwidths of all listeners under an instance cannot exceed the bandwidth of that instance.

 By default, all listeners share the bandwidth of the SLB instance.

 **Note:** Instances billed by traffic have no bandwidth peak limit by default.

 |
    |**Get Client Source IP Address**|The backend server of a UDP listener can directly obtain the real IP of the client.**Note:** UDP listeners of an SLB instance of the classic network do not support viewing the source IP address.

|
    |**Automatically Enable Listener After Creation**|Choose whether to enable listener after the listener is configured. The listener is enabled by default.|

2.  Click **Next**.

## Step 3 Add backend servers {#section_ylm_3qn_42b .section}

Add backend servers to process requests. You can use the default server group configured for the instance, or configure a VServer group or an active/standby server group for the listener. For more information, see [Backend server overview](reseller.en-US/User Guide/后端服务器/Backend server overview.md#).

In this tutorial, the default server group is used:

1.  Select **Default Server Group** and then click **Add**.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16139/154218088510030_en-US.png)

2.  Select the ECS instances to add and then click **Add to Selected Server List**. Click **OK**.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16139/15421808857499_en-US.png)

3.  Configure the ports and weights of the added backend servers.
    -   Port

        The port opened on the backend server \(ECS instance\) to receive requests. The port number is in the range of 1-65535. Ports of backend servers can be the same in an SLB instance.

    -   Weight

        The weight of the backend server \(ECS instance\). An ECS instance with a higher weight will receive a larger number of connection requests.

        **Note:** If the weight is set to 0, no requests will be sent to the ECS instance.

        ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16139/15421808857504_en-US.png)

4.  Click **Next**.

## Step 4 Configure health check {#section_ay4_jqn_42b .section}

Server Load Balancer checks the service availability of the backend servers \(ECS instances\) by performing health checks. The health check function improves the overall availability of your services and avoids the impact of backend server failures. Click **Modify** to change health check configurations. For more information, see [Configure health check](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Health check/Configure health check.md#).

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16139/154218088510032_en-US.png)

## Step 5 Submit the configurations {#section_ey5_lqn_42b .section}

To confirm the listener configurations, complete these steps:

1.  On the Submit page, check listener configurations. You can click **Modify** the change the configurations.
2.  Click **Submit**.
3.  On the Submit page, click **OK** after the configurations are successful.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16139/154218088510033_en-US.png)


After the configurations are successful, you can view the created listener on the Listeners page.
