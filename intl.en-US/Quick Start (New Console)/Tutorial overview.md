# Tutorial overview {#concept_ybd_pfl_vdb .concept}

This tutorial guides you to create an Internet SLB instance to forward requests to backend ECS instances.

**Note:** Before creating an SLB instance, you must plan your SLB service, such as the instance type, region, and more. For more information, see [Before you begin](reseller.en-US/Quick Start (New Console)/Before you begin.md#).

The tutorial includes the following tasks:

1.  [Create an SLB instance](reseller.en-US/Quick Start (New Console)/Create an SLB instance.md#) 

    Creates an SLB instance. An SLB instance is a running entity of Server Load Balancer.

2.  [Configure listeners and add backend servers](reseller.en-US/Quick Start (New Console)/Configure an SLB instance.md#) 

    After creating an SLB instance, you must add at least one listener, and add ECS instances as backend servers.

3.  [Resolve a domain name](reseller.en-US/Quick Start (New Console)/Resolve a domain name.md#) \(Optional\)

    Use Alibaba Cloud DNS to resolve a domain name to the IP address of the SLB instance to provide external services.

4.  [Delete an SLB instance](reseller.en-US/Quick Start (New Console)/Delete an SLB instance.md#) 

    If you no longer need the SLB instance, release it to avoid additional charges.
