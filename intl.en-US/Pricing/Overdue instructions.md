# Overdue instructions {#concept_lb1_w3n_22b .concept}

A notification will be sent to you when an instance is overdue.

The following will happen when an instance is overdue:

-   If an instance payment becomes overdue, you can still use the service for another 15 days. You will receive an email that reminds you to make a payment and get services renewed. The service will not be affected if the payment is made within 15 days.

-   If you do not renew the service after the payment is overdue for 15 days, the service will be stopped. No fees are charged to the Server Load Balancer instance when the service is stopped. Instance configuration and related data will be reserved for another 15 days after the service is stopped.

-   If you recharge your delinquent account within 15 days after the service is stopped, the instance will be automatically restarted.

-   If you do not recharge your delinquent account within 15 days after the service is stopped, the instance will be released.

-   An email reminder will be sent to you one day before the instance is released. Once the instance is released, the configuration data will be permanently deleted and cannot be restored.
