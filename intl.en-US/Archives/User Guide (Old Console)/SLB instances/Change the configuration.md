# Change the configuration {#task_epd_ctm_vdb .task}

You can change a shared-performance instance to a guaranteed-performance instance, or modify the capacity of a guaranteed-performance instance.

Before modifying the instance configuration, note the following:

-   If you change a shared-performance instance to a guaranteed-performance instance, a brief disconnection of service may occur for 10 to 30 seconds. We recommend that you change the specification when the business is not busy.
-   Once a shared-performance instance is changed to a guaranteed-performance instance, it cannot be changed back.

    You can use the \(slb.s1.small\) capacity instead after changing to the guaranteed-performance instance.
