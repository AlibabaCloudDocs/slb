    SLB supports viewing the following monitor metrics.

    |Monitor metrics|Description|
    |:--------------|:----------|
    |**Traffic**|     -   Inbound traffic: The traffic consumed by external access.
    -   Outbound traffic: The traffic consumed by Server Load Balancer.
 |
    |**Packet**|     -   Inbound packet: The number of request packets received per second.
    -   Outbound packet: The number of response packets sent per second.
 |
    |**Concurrent connection count**|     -   Active connection: The number of established TCP connections. If persistent connections are used, a connection can transfer multiple file requests at one time.
    -   Inactive connection: The number of TCP connections that are not in the established status. You can use `netstat -an` command to view the active connections.
    -   Concurrent connection: The total number of TCP connections.
 |
    |**New connection**|The average number of new TCP connections established from clients to the Server Load Balancer in the statistical period.|
    |**Dropped Traffic**|     -   Dropped inbound traffic: The amount of inbound traffic dropped per second.
    -   Dropped outbound traffic: The amount of outbound traffic dropped per second.
 |
    |**Dropped Packet**|     -   Dropped inbound packet: The number of inbound packets dropped per second.
    -   Dropped outbound packet: The number of outbound packets dropped per second.
 |
    |**Dropped Connection**|The number of TCP connections dropped per second.|
    |The following metrics are specific to Layer-7 listeners.|
    |**QPS**|The number of HTTP/HTTPS requests that can be handled per second.|
    |**RT**|The average response time of Server Load Balancer.|
    |**Status Code\(2XX\)/\(3xx\)/\(4xx\)\(5xx\)\(Others\)**|The average number of HTTP response codes generated by the listener.|
    |**UpstreamCode4XX/5XX**|The average number of HTTP response codes generated by the backend server.|
    |**UpstreamRT**|The average response time of the backend server.|
