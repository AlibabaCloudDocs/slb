# Billing rule adjustment for the minimum specification of guaranteed-performance SLB instances

The limited-time offer for getting a free guaranteed-performance Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance with the slb.s1.small specification will end in April 2020. Instances that are created after April 2020 will be charged.The price of the slb.s1.small instance is adjusted to USD 0.006 per hour. The price rate varies with regions. For more information, see [Billing method](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/CLB Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).The following section describes the billing rules:

You are charged a specification fee for slb.s1.small instances purchased after the effective date of the billing rule.

SLB slb.s1.small instances purchased before the effective date of the billing rule are still free of charge. If you upgrade or downgrade the configurations of an instance after the effective date of the billing rule, you are charged a specification fee.

After the billing rule takes effect, if any pay-as-you-go instance higher than the slb.s1.small specification is downgraded to slb.s1.small, it will be charged based on the slb.s1.small specification. For more information, see [Billing methods](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/CLB Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).

The preceding adjustment will be applied step by step from April 2020. The effective date of the billing rule may vary with regions and sites. See your bills for actual fees.
